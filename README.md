## Important info

In order to build the code and make it functional, you need a Marvel Public and Private Key and add them into the [apikey.properties ](https://github.com/BugiaDev/Marvel/blob/main/apikeys.properties) like

    PUBLIC_KEY="yourPublicKey"
    PRIVATE_KEY="yourPrivateKey"

You can grab some creating an account [here] (https://developer.marvel.com/account)
